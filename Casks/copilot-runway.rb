  caveats <<~EOS
    Copilot Runway is ad-hoc signed and not notarized by Apple, so macOS
    blocks the first launch.

    To open it the first time:
      1. Open Copilot Runway from /Applications. macOS shows a warning.
         Click Done.
      2. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security, scroll down, and click
         "Open Anyway" next to the message about Copilot Runway. Confirm
         with your password.

    Alternative from the terminal:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/CopilotRunway.app
  EOS
end
